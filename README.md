 ## Fidget Spinner
 
 I think about a final project. One of the problem I faced was that as Iam just 10th I don't know about drawing electric circuit. Then think about 'fidget spinner' which was having a huge market. 
 
 A fidget spinner is a toy that consists of a ball-bearing in the center of a multi-lobed flat structure made from metal or plastic designed to spin along its axis with little effort.The toy has been advertised as helping people who have trouble with focusing or fidgeting by relieving nervous energy or psychological stress. There are claims that a fidget spinner can be used to help calm people down who suffer from anxiety and other neurological disorders like ADHD and Autism.[For more information click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_spinner)

 I buy bearing from a nearby shop and fixed it. First it was not spinning well. So I added oil in the bearing. Thus, it was spinning well. I was very happy by seeing this.
